/**
 * Experimental decorator to investigate type generation approaches
 * Goal: Generate and export encrypted companion types without using 'any'
 */

// Approach 1: Using TypeScript's transformer API (compile-time)
// This would require a custom TypeScript transformer

// Approach 2: Using build-time code generation
// This would analyze the AST and generate types

// Approach 3: Using module augmentation
// This would try to augment the module with generated types

// Let's start with a simple decorator that tries to export types
export function Encrypt<T extends new (...args: any[]) => any>(
  constructor: T,
  context: ClassDecoratorContext
): void {
  const className = context.name || 'AnonymousClass';
  const encryptedClassName = `Encrypted${className}`;
  
  // This is what we want to achieve - but TypeScript doesn't allow this at compile time
  // We need to find a way to make this type available
  
  console.log(`Decorator applied to ${className}, would generate ${encryptedClassName}`);
  
  // The challenge: How do we make EncryptedClassName available as a TypeScript type?
  // without using 'any' and without manual interface definitions
}

// Let's try a different approach using module augmentation
declare global {
  // This won't work because we can't dynamically add to global namespace
  // namespace GeneratedTypes {
  //   // We need to find a way to add types here dynamically
  // }
}

// Approach 4: Using a type registry pattern
// This might be the most promising approach

interface TypeRegistry {
  [className: string]: {
    original: new (...args: any[]) => any;
    encrypted: new (...args: any[]) => any;
  };
}

// This would be populated at runtime, but we need compile-time types
const typeRegistry: TypeRegistry = {};

// The key insight: We need to find a way to make TypeScript aware of the generated types
// at compile time, not runtime

export { typeRegistry };
